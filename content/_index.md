nothing really intresting here, just me and my (probably) inactive site

in [learning]({{< relref "learning" >}}) you can find some notes I write for things I learn, I mostly write them
in my personal google drive, but some small portions ill put here :)

in [blog]({{< relref "blog" >}}) you can find some thoughts, openions and other shit you don't care about all in one place!


#### who tf am I?!!1
edgy programmer, how edgy?
 - I use arch BTW
 - read programming books
 - learn C because only smart people know C
 - I wrote this website in [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and not `react` like any other soyboy programmer
 - I dislike modern web (in specific cases I like the modern web)
 - ugly/bad code will literally hurt my soul (aka my old code)
 - I learned programming by myself, so my ego is (probably) high, I am working on it!
 - learned computer networking and graduated with diploma
 - learned pen testing (althoug I don't remember shit because I don't really use this KNOWLEDGE)
 - CCNA, probably expired by the time you read this

ohh and did I mention already that I use arch BTW?

come, follow me on github, I won't spam your feed and I won't return a follow [come come, click](https://github.com/dsal3389)
