## rust lang
I am not here to explain what rust is, I am here to give my openion you don't care about.

## rust is annoying
rust is so fucking annoying

### unwrap
the unwrap syntax is so bad, I might don't know how to write rust because I see other code
bases and they don't use unwrap so much like I do

the whole concept of `traits` is genius, but the executing is
terrible (I am probably just bad),
