I acknowledge that apple has better protection then android but the amount of pain I
experiance with Iphone does not worth it.

my first Iphone was back in 2015, iphone 5s I think it was, I was 15yo, and I wanted to have
an iphone because "it was better then android", I didn't know why, everyone just said so, my personal experiance
with that iphone (5s) was... shitty... it was warming up fast, burning my fingers, the screen broke way
too easily and... yeah thats all I remember, it didn't have anything special other then the stauts.

few years ago I bought my small sister iphone 12 pro max (when it just came out), the best of the best for my sister,
it looked nice, I like the blocky and simple design, but the UI looked shitty, the flavor only apple knows
how to make.

now, I choose after almost 10years to buy an iphone for myself, 15 plus because I don't really need "pro" camera or "features"
I just want a big screen and a functional phone **functional**, well after 7 months (at the time of writing) I have
enough experiance to complain about this shitty phone, ugh... so bad...

## can't block sms alphabet sender ID
_ill start with my first and BIGGEST problem I experianced_

I found this problem at the next day I bought the phone, at that moment I regretted buying this
junk.

you know those SMS you get from companies, like dominos, macdonalds and other... where the number
is behind a name, so it will show you "new message from dominos"

**YOU CAN't BLOCK THOSE**, YES, you just can't, even me writing about it now make me want to take that
phone and smash it to the ground, such a simple feature is impossible... f*** apple

you can silence those senders so you won't get notifications, but your SMS list will
still show them on the main scroll page along with all your other conversations so when you will
look for an old SMS you need, you will have to scroll throught all of those spam SMS

## evey application require payment
no, I don't have problem with paid apps, I have problem with shitty and one-time use apps that
require payment.

I don't have a lot of apps on my phone, I mainly use whatsapp, telegram, gmail and other work related apps.

I wanted to check my home wifi strength with an app, now this kind of app is one time use, you download it,
you use it once and you delete it; surprise surprise, EVERYTHING REQUIRES SUBSCRIPTION, all I want is just to
check my wifi strength ToT, why I need to pay for subscription?!?!?

I shit u not, I took my old android and used some off the shelf app for it...

from my experiance the app store looks something like that (those numbers are based on my experiance and are not
really accourate)

  * 10% paid apps
  * 80% free apps with subscription to use them
  * 10% actually free apps


## small cloud storage
the free basic cloud storage is inhumanely small, 5Gig (we are not in 1990, this is small storage)
so I can literally backup 300 -+ photos, not that I care about the photos but my whatsapp chats
are not backedup because that shitty cloud storage is full.

I paid for a "primium" phone just to get f**ed in the ass with monthly payments left and right, why I complain about
this?? because google gives you 15gigs for free which is more then enough for most people,
I live happly with 15gigs for mail + images + whatsapp backup + files, but apple gives me only 5Gigs
of (shitty) cloud storage


# things I liked

## dynamic island
this is the only feature I liked about the iphone, the dynamic island is a good
use of the notch, it actually has very usful cases for example if I have GPS navigation on, I can exit the
GPS app to do other things and click on the notch to go back quickly to the GPS app

it has nice ui why someone is calling you or when you play music

---

yeah thats it, thats the only thing I liked about this shitty iphone.

iphone is just a shitty product by a shitty company that sees their users
as walking wallets;

I have so many things to write about their shitty mac laptop, luckly the mac was laptop from work so I didn't
pay apple (I wasn't scammed by apple to be more accurate) and I literally replaced it with windows thinkpad after 9 months
